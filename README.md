Hello!
My name is Wael Sheikh, and I'm a student in FAST, Karachi.
I've nearly no coding experience and i find coding very intriguing and exciting to learn.
When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me drawing, out for walks, or asleep on my bed. 
I love meeting new people, sharing ideas, and finding creative solutions to interesting problems.
I'm always up for a good conversation about technology, music, or the best hidden gems.
Born on 06-06-06, I was raised for the majority of my life in Riyadh.
Being half Pakistani, half Moroccan, i have exposure to different culteres and traditions and found it easy to get along with people.
As for my education, I have given A-levels for Pre-Medical along with additional Mathematics.
